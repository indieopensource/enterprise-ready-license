# Enterprise Ready Open Software License Supplement

## <a id="Purpose"></a>Purpose

This license fills the gaps between the terms that open software developers apply to their work and the terms that companies expect for software they rely on. Open software developers can sell supplementary licenses to companies on these terms to fill those gaps.

## <a id="Agreement"></a>Agreement

These terms, together with the cosigned **Proposal** referencing them, make up an agreement between **Developer** and **Company**.

## <a id="Specifics"></a>Specifics

1.  The _Proposal_ must identify:

    1.  the _Developer_

    2.  whether the _Developer_ is an individual or a company

    3.  the _Company_

    4.  the **Software** this agreement

    5.  the **Fee** for this agreement

2.  The _Proposal_ may identify:

    1.  the **Payment Method** _Company_ will use to pay the _Fee_, which by default is bank-to-bank transfer, such as FedWire, ACH, SEPA, or SWIFT, if possible, and otherwise a common electronic payment system, such as PayPal, Stripe, or Square Cash

    2.  the **Term** of this agreement, which by default is one calendar year

## <a id="Supplementary_Terms"></a>Supplementary Terms

These terms supplement the **Public License** that applies to the _Software_. Though part of a single transaction, these terms and the _Public License_ will be interpreted as entirely independent legal documents, so that _Developer_ and _Company_ can continue to rely on guidance for the _Public License_ as a standardized form.

## <a id="Company's_Obligations"></a>Company's Obligations

### <a id="Pay_Fees"></a>Pay Fees

_Company_ agrees to pay the _Fee_ via the _Payment Method_ within seven calendar days of entering this agreement.

### <a id="Use_the_Payment_Method"></a>Use the Payment Method

_Company_ agrees to pay all fees under this agreement via the _Payment Method_.

### <a id="Cover_Payment_Method_Expenses"></a>Cover Payment Method Expenses

1.  _Developer_ guarantees that _Developer_ has all the rights needed to license work in the _Software_ as of the date of this agreement.

2.  _Developer_ guarantees that _Developer_ will not release or incorporate any work into the _Software_ that _Developer_ does not have the right to license.

### <a id="Understand_Intellectual_Property_Basics"></a>Understand Intellectual Property Basics

_Developer_ guarantees that _Developer_ is broadly aware that:

Legal "work made for hire" rules can make employers and clients, rather than developers, owners of intellectual property in software.

#### <a id="Intellectual_Property_Assignments"></a>Intellectual Property Assignments

Common legal agreements, such as independent contractor, employee, and company founder agreements, assign ownership of intellectual property to companies.

#### <a id="Owners_License"></a>Owners License

### <a id="Provide_Assurance_About_Patents"></a>Provide Assurance About Patents

_Developer_ guarantees that as of the date of this agreement, _Developer_ is not aware of any patent that the _Software_ infringes, or that _Company_ would infringe by _Expected Use of the Software_, that is not covered by the _Public License_.

1.  _Developer_ guarantees that any _Software Dependencies_ are and will be _Open Software_ generally available for _Company_ to download, free of charge, from a _Public Software Repository_.

2.  _Company_ agrees that _Developer_ may rely on public statements by developers of software, copies of and references to specific public licenses in "README", "LICENSE", source code, and similar files, and licensing metadata in "package.json" and similar, standardized metadata files, to determine whether _Software Dependencies_ are _Open Software_.

3.  _Developer_ does not agree to any service-level agreement or other specific guarantee about any _Public Software Repository_.

### <a id="Ensure_License_Compatibility"></a>Ensure License Compatibility

_Developer_ guarantees that the license terms for _Software Dependencies_ and the _Public License_ are and will remain compatible, so that _Developer_ and others have permission to run, combine, and distribute the combination of _Software_ and its _Software Dependencies_.

### <a id="Make_Patent_License_Explicit"></a>Make Patent License Explicit

If the _Public License_ does not explicitly grant a patent license, then _Developer_ licenses _Company_ to do everything with the software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims _Developer_ can license, or becomes able to license.

### <a id="Forgive_Inadvertent_Public_License_Violations"></a>Forgive Inadvertent Public License Violations
