    \Purpose\  This license fills the gaps between the terms that open source software developers apply to their work and the terms that companies expect for software they depend on.  Open source software developers can sell supplementary licenses to companies on these terms to fill those gaps.

    \Agreement\  These terms, together with the cosigned ""Proposal"" referencing them, make up an agreement between the ""Developer"" selling the license and the ""Company"" buying the license.

    \Deal Details\

        \\  The <Proposal> must identify:

            \\  the <Developer>

            \\  whether the <Developer> is an individual or a company

            \\  the <Company>

            \\  the ""Software"" the license covers

            \\  the ""License Fee"" for the license

        \\  The <Proposal> may identify:

            \\  the ""Payment Method"" <Company> will use to pay the <License Fee>, which by default is [default payment method]

            \\  the ""Term"" of the license, [default term] by default

    \Supplementary Terms\  These terms supplement the ""Public License"" that applies to the <Software>.  Though part of a single transaction, these terms and the <Public License> will be interpreted as entirely independent legal documents, so that <Developer> and <Company> can continue to rely on guidance for the <Public License> as a standardized form.

    \Company's Obligations\

        \Pay Fees\  <Company> agrees to pay the <License Fee> via the <Payment Method> within [first payment deadline] of entering this agreement.

        \Use the Agreed Payment Method\  <Company> agrees to pay all fees under this agreement via the <Payment Method>.

        \Cover Payment Method Expenses\  <Company> agrees to increase the amount of every payment to <Developer> so that <Developer> receives the full amount owed, net of any fees for use of the <Payment Method>.

        \Pay Tax\  <Company> agrees to pay all tax on fees under this agreement, except tax <Developer> owes on income.

        \Survival\  {Company's Obligations} continues after this agreement ends.

    \Developer's Obligations\

        \Ensure Rights to License\

            \\  <Developer> guarantees that <Developer> has all the rights needed to license work in the <Software> as of the date of this agreement.

            \\  <Developer> guarantees that <Developer> will not release or incorporate any work into the <Software> that <Developer> does not have the right to license.

        \Understand Intellectual Property Basics\  <Developer> guarantees that <Developer> is broadly aware that:

            \Work Made for Hire\  Legal "work made for hire" rules can make employers and clients, rather than developers, owners of intellectual property in software.

            \Intellectual Property Assignments\  Common legal agreements, such as independent contractor, employee, and company founder agreements, assign ownership of intellectual property to companies.

            \Owners License\  When work made for hire rules or an assignment agreement transfers ownership of intellectual property in software to a company, then the company, not the developer, has the legal right to license the software.

        \Provide Assurance About Patents\  <Developer> guarantees that as of the date of this agreement, <Developer> is not aware of any patent that the <Software> infringes, or that <Company> would infringe by <Expected Use of the Software>, that is not covered by the <Public License>.

        \Only Depend on Open Software\  <Developer> guarantees that any <Software Dependencies> are <Open Software> and generally available for <Company> to download, free of charge, from a <Public Software Repository>.  <Developer> does not agree to any service-level agreement or other specific guarantee about any <Public Software Repository>.

        \Ensure License Compatibility\  <Developer> guarantees that the license terms for <Software Dependencies> and the <Public License> are compatible, so that <Developer> and others have permission to run, combine, and distribute the combination of <Software> and its <Software Dependencies>.

    # This section is based on the "Patent" section of the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0.
    \Clear Patent License\  If the <Public License> does not explicitly grant a patent license, then <Developer> licenses <Company> to do everything with the software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims <Developer> can license, or becomes able to license.

    # This section based on the "Excuse" section of the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0.
    \Cure Process for Public License Violations\  <Developer> agrees that if <Company> fails to comply with any condition or other rule of the <Public License>, <Company> can keep its license by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after receiving notice of the failure, from <Developer> or anyone else.

    \Term\  This agreement starts when <Developer> receives full payment of the <License Fee>, and continues for the <Term>.

    \Renewal\  <Company> may renew this agreement, for an additional period as long as the <Term>, by paying <Developer> the <License Fee> fee again during the [renewal payment period] before the <Term> would otherwise end.

    \Accountability\

        \Indemnification\  Subject to {Indemnification Process}, <Developer> agrees to give <Company> <Indemnification> for <Legal Claims> by others alleging that <Expected Use of the Software> does any of these:

        \\  infringes any copyright, trademark, or trade secret

        \\  infringes any patent covered by <Developer>'s patent guarantee under {Provide Assurance About Patents}

        \Only Recourse\  <Company>'s only legal remedy for <Legal Claims> covered by <Indemnification> will be <Indemnification>.

    \Liability\

        \Only Express Warranties!!  With the exception of its obligations in {Developer's Obligations}, <Developer> provides the <Software> as is, without any warranty.

        \Limited Damages!!

            \Damages Limit!!  Subject to {Damages Limit Exceptions}, <Developer>'s total liability for breach of this agreement will not exceed the amount <Company> paid <Developer> under this agreement during the twelve months before the first claim is filed.  This limit applies even if <Developer> is advised that <Company> may suffer damages, and even if <Company> paid nothing at all.

            \Damages Limit Exceptions\  {Limited Damages} does not limit damages for breach of:

                \\  {Accountability}

                \\  {Company's Obligations}

        \Indemnification Process\  Both sides agree that to receive <Indemnification> under this agreement, they must give <Notice> of any covered <Legal Claims> quickly, allow the other side to control investigation, defense, and settlement, and cooperate with those efforts.  Both sides agree that if they fail to give <Notice> of any covered <Legal Claims> quickly, <Indemnification> will not cover amounts that could have been defended against or mitigated if <Notice> had been given quickly.
