    \Purpose\  This license fills gaps between the terms open software developers apply to their work and the terms companies expect for software they rely on.  Open software developers can sell supplementary licenses to companies on these terms to fill those gaps.

    \Agreement\  These terms, together with the cosigned ""Proposal"" referencing them, make up an agreement between ""Developer"" and ""Company"".

    \Specifics\

        \\  The <Proposal> must identify:

            \\  the <Developer>

            \\  whether the <Developer> is an individual or a company

            \\  the <Company>

            \\  the ""Software"" this agreement covers

            \\  the ""Fee"" for this agreement

        \\  The <Proposal> may identify:

            \\  the ""Payment Method"" <Company> will use to pay the <Fee>, which by default is [default payment method]

            \\  the ""Term"" of this agreement, which by default is [default term]

    \Supplementary Terms\  These terms supplement the ""Public License"" that applies to the <Software>.  Though part of a single transaction, these terms and the <Public License> will be interpreted as entirely independent legal documents, so that <Developer> and <Company> can continue to rely on guidance for the <Public License> as a standardized form.

    \Company's Obligations\

        \Pay Fees\  <Company> agrees to pay the <Fee> via the <Payment Method> within [first payment deadline] of entering this agreement.

        \Use the Agreed Payment Method\  <Company> agrees to pay all fees under this agreement via the <Payment Method>.

        \Cover Payment Method Fees\  <Company> agrees to increase the amount of each payment to <Developer> so that <Developer> receives the full amount owed, net of any fees for use of the <Payment Method>.

        \Pay Taxes on Fees\  <Company> agrees to pay all tax on fees under this agreement, except tax <Developer> owes on income.

        \Term of Company's Obligations\  {Company's Obligations} continues after this agreement ends.

    \Developer's Obligations\

        \Understand Intellectual Property Basics\  <Developer> guarantees that <Developer> is aware that:

            \\  Legal "work made for hire" rules can make employers and clients, rather than developers, owners of intellectual property in software.

            \\  Common legal agreements, such as independent contractor, employee, and company founder agreements, transfer ownership of intellectual property from developers to companies.

            \\  When a work made for hire rule or assignment agreement transfers ownership of intellectual property in software to a company, then the company, not the developer, has the legal right to license the software.

        \Secure Rights to License the Software\

            \Rights for Current Software\  <Developer> guarantees that <Developer> has all the rights needed to make the <Latest Version of the Software> available under the <Public License>.

            \Rights for Future Software\  <Developer> guarantees that <Developer> will not incorporate any work into the <Latest Version of the Software> that <Developer> does not have the right to make available under the <Public License>.

            \Contribution Licensing Records\  <Developer> agrees to collect published records showing that other contributors to the <Latest Version of the Software> license their contributions on terms that permit making their work available under the <Public License> as part of the <Latest Version of the Software>.

        \Don't Hide Patent Problems\  <Developer> guarantees that as of the date of this agreement, <Developer> is not aware of any patent not covered by the <Public License> that the <Latest Version of the Software> infringes, or that <Company> would infringe by <Expected Use of the Software>.

        \Only Depend on Open Software\

            \\  <Developer> guarantees that any <Dependencies> are and will be <Open Software> generally available for <Company> to download, free of charge, from a <Public Software Repository>.

            \\  <Company> agrees that <Developer> may rely on copies of and references to specific public licenses in "README", "LICENSE", source code, and similar files, and licensing metadata in "package.json" and similar, standardized metadata files, to determine whether <Dependencies> are <Open Software>.

            \\  <Developer> does not agree to any service-level agreement or other specific guarantee about any <Public Software Repository>.

        \Avoid License Compatibility Problems\  <Developer> guarantees that the license terms for <Dependencies> and the <Public License> are and will remain collectively compatible, so that <Developer> and others have permission to run, combine, and distribute the combination of <Software> and its <Dependencies>.

        \Keep Malicious Code Out of the Software\  <Developer> guarantees that the <Software> does not and will not contain computer viruses, Trojans, worms, or other malicious code.

        # This section is based on the "Patent" section of the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0.
        \Make Patent Permission Explicit\  If the <Public License> does not explicitly grant a patent license, then <Developer> licenses <Company> to do everything with the <Software> that would otherwise infringe any patent claims <Developer> can license, or becomes able to license.

        # This section based on the "Excuse" section of the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0.
        \Forgive Inadvertent Public License Violations\  <Developer> agrees that if <Company> fails to comply with any condition or other rule of the <Public License>, <Company> can keep its license by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 calendar days after receiving notice of the failure from <Developer> or anyone else.

        \Stand Behind Guarantees\

            \Indemnification\  Subject to {Indemnification Process}, <Developer> agrees to give <Company> <Indemnification> for <Legal Claims> by others:

                \\  resulting from breach of {Secure Rights to License the Software}

                \\  resulting from breach of {Only Depend on Open Software}

                \\  resulting from breach of {Avoid License Compatibility Problems}

                \\  resulting from breach of {Keep Malicious Code Out of the Software}

                \\  that the <Latest Version of the Software> infringes any patent covered by <Developer>'s guarantee under {Don't Hide Patent Problems}

            \Only Recourse\  <Company>'s only legal remedy for <Legal Claims> covered by <Indemnification> will be <Indemnification>.

        \Term of Developer's Obligations\  {Developer's Obligations} continues until this agreement ends.

    \Term\  This agreement starts when <Developer> receives full payment of the <Fee>, and continues for the <Term>.

    \Renewal\  <Company> may renew this agreement, for an additional period as long as the <Term>, by paying <Developer> the <Fee> fee again during the [renewal payment period] before the <Term> would otherwise end.  <Developer> may stop <Company> from renewing this agreement by giving <Notice> any time before <Company> pays an additional <Fee>.

    \Liability\

        \Only Express Warranties!!  With the exception of <Developer>'s obligations in {Developer's Obligations}, <Developer> provides the <Software> as is, without any warranty.

        \Limited Damages!!

            \Damages Limit!!  Subject to {Damages Limit Exceptions}, <Developer>'s total liability for breach of this agreement will not exceed the amount of the last <Fee> that <Company> paid <Developer> under this agreement.  This limit applies even if <Developer> is advised that <Company> may suffer damages, and even if <Company> paid nothing at all.

            \Damages Limit Exceptions\  {Limited Damages} does not limit damages for breach of:

                \\  {Stand Behind Guarantees}

                \\  {Company's Obligations}

If either side finds that e-mail can't be delivered to the e-mail address given, it may give <Notice> by registered mail to the address on file for the recipient with the state under whose laws it is organized, if the recipient is a company, or to the recipient's home address, if the recipient is an individual.

        \Indemnification Process\  <Company> agrees that to receive <Indemnification> under this agreement, <Company> must give <Notice> of any covered <Legal Claims> quickly, allow <Developer> to control investigation, defense, and settlement, and cooperate with those efforts.  <Company> agree that if <Company> fails to give <Notice> of any covered <Legal Claims> quickly, <Indemnification> will not cover amounts that could have been defended against or mitigated if <Notice> had been given quickly.  <Developer> agrees that if <Developer> takes control of the defense and settlement of any <Legal Claims> covered by <Indemnification>, <Developer> will not agree to any settlements that admit fault for, or impose obligations on, <Company> without <Company>'s <Permission>.
